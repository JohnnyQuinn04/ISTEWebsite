    <h2>Understanding Alignment in Design</h2>
    
    <p>The principles of CRAP—Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity—form the basis for creating visually effective layouts. Among these, <strong>Alignment</strong> plays an essential role in organizing and structuring content. Poor or inefficient alignment can drastically affect how viewers perceive and understand a design.</p>

    <h2>What is Alignment?</h2>
    <p>Alignment refers to the arrangement of elements in a design so that they are visually connected, forming a clean and orderly layout. When elements are aligned correctly, it creates harmony and order, helping viewers process information more easily.</p>

    <h3>Importance of Alignment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduces Visual Clutter:</strong> Proper alignment minimizes distractions and visual clutter, making the design easier to navigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Improves Readability:</strong> When text and images align to a common axis, the eye moves from element to element smoothly, improving the flow of information.</li>
        <li><strong>Creates Relationships:</strong> Even unrelated elements can appear connected when aligned. This helps in grouping information intuitively, especially in complex layouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Gives a Professional Feel:</strong> Good alignment elevates the overall design, making it look polished and professional. Poor alignment, on the other hand, can create a chaotic or unfinished feel, which may lead to confusion.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Alignment plays a crucial role in the overall success of a design. When done correctly, it ensures that content is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and professionally presented.</p>
