    <h2>What is Alignment?</h2>
    <p>
        The principles of CRAP – contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity – form some basis upon 
        which a visually effective layout can be designed. Alignment is one of those core principles 
        that plays an important role in structuring and organizing the content. Poor or inefficient 
        alignment of elements can completely alter the viewer's perception and sometimes even their 
        understanding of the design. Alignment allows the designer to achieve a professional feel, 
        giving the design polish and instilling confidence to push through the content with surety. 
        The lack of good alignment makes a design feel chaotic or unfinished and may cause confusion 
        or disinterest.

    <h2>Why is Alignment Important?</h2>
    <p>
        Alignment ensures that elements in a design are visually aligned, so as to present a more 
        orderly appearance. Where there is good alignment of elements, then there exists an effect 
        of order and harmony to the information on view and its understanding becomes quite easier. 
        For example, when text and images align to a common axis, the eye would usually move from 
        element to element without any distraction, hence reducing visual clutter and improving 
        readability. Good alignment also creates relationships between dissimilar elements: items 
        aligned with each other convey a relationship, even if they are quite unrelated in content. 
        This implied relationship will enable the viewer intuitively to group information, which can 
        help considerably in more complex compositions where many different components have to be 
        brought into account for proper visual organization.
