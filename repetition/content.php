    <h2>What is Repetition?</h2>
    <p>
        Repetition is the act of repeating something. In the context of web design that something 
        is often design elements like colors, patterns, shapes and even layouts. The main role of 
        repetition is to keep the design consistent, or at least to help when grouping elements. 
        Unlike contrast, repetition relies on things being similar to achieve its goals. This leads 
        to some difficulty in balancing the two as too much repetition will limit contrast while 
        too sporadic use of contrast makes grouping related elements by repetition impossible.

    <h2>Why is Repetition Important?</h2>
    <p>
        Repetition plays a crucial role in organizing and simplifying information. Proper use of 
        repetition makes it easier to navigate a site but keeping similar elements consistent in 
        color or pattern, making it so users donâ€™t need to look over the entire page to find the 
        next point in the chain. This design principle also prevents a site from feeling cluttered 
        and instead unifies the overall appearance, creating a cohesive experience.
