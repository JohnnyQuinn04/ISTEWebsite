    <h2>What is Proximity?</h2>
    <p>Proximity refers to the principle of grouping related elements together to create a visual connection. When items are placed near each other, they appear related, making it easier for users to understand the structure and meaning of the content. Proximity helps organize information effectively and reduces visual clutter by establishing clear relationships between elements.</p>

    <h2>Why is Proximity Important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Helps users identify related elements quickly and intuitively.</li>
        <li>Reduces visual clutter by organizing content logically.</li>
        <li>Improves readability by grouping similar content together.</li>
        <li>Enhances the user experience by guiding the eye through the design naturally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Proximity</h2>

    <h3>Example 1: Form Design</h3>
    <p>In forms, placing labels close to their corresponding input fields improves usability. When labels are far from the fields they describe, users may struggle to understand the form layout.</p>

    <h3>Example 2: Navigation Menus</h3>
    <p>Navigation menus often group related links together to help users find content easily. Separating unrelated links with spacing improves the menuâ€™s clarity and usability.</p>
