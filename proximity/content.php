    <h2>What is Proximity?</h2>
    <p>
        Proximity is a design principle that refers to the spatial relationships between objects by 
        grouping them together or spreading them apart. Elements in close proximity are interpreted as 
        sharing similar properties or being part of the same grouping. This principle helps users 
        understand and organize the provided information. It can also be used to separate unrelated 
        elements to create a clear visual hierarchy and improve overall communication of the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Proximity Important?</h2>
    <p>
        The concept of proximity improves both readability and usability by clustering similar 
        elements together while clearly distancing unrelated ones. This approach establishes visual 
        groupings, making the site feel more approachable and easier to navigate. This organization 
        allows users to quickly understand the main points of the information, making the overall 
        experience more efficient and user-friendly.
